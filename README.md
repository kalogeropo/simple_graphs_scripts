testing graph decomposition 

Given graph2.txt as a graph we calculate the truss and core decomposition and then colouring nodes depending on the levels of 
decomposition. 

Known issue needs generalaization

possible fix: adding a pallet of colors as a list and the level is depicted as the index of that list
